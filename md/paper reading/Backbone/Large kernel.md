## Note：

1.  *Why ViTs super powerful? MSA plays a key role which is more flexible, capable (less inductive bias), more robust to distortions, able to model long-range dependencies and etc.* However, some recent researches challenge the necessity of MSA.

## Q&A：

1.  shape bias rather than texture bias 是指啥
2.
